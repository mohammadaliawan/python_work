## A simple calculator program for +.-,* and /

This program will get two numbers and an operation to perform from the user and display the result.

## Loan Calculator

You'll need three pieces of information:

the loan amount
the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
the loan duration
From the above, you'll need to calculate the following two things:

monthly interest rate
loan duration in months
You can use the following formula:

m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))
m = monthly payment
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months
Hints:
Figure out what format your inputs need to be in. For example, should the interest rate be expressed as 5 or .05, if you mean 5% interest?
If you're working with Annual Percentage Rate (APR), you'll need to convert that to a monthly interest rate.
Be careful about the loan duration -- are you working with months or years? Choose variable names carefully to assist in remembering.**

## RPS Game

In this assignment, we'll build a Rock Paper Scissors game. The game flow should go like this:

the user makes a choice
the computer makes a choice
the winner is displayed

Here are a couple of bonus features for the Rock Paper Scissors program.

Lizard Spock

This game is a variation on the Rock Paper Scissors game that adds two more options - Lizard and Spock. The full explanation and rules are here. There's also a hilarious Big Bang Theory video about it here.

The goal of this bonus is to add Lizard and Spock into your code.

Typing the full word "rock" or "lizard" is tiring. Update the program so the user can type "r" for "rock," "p" for "paper," etc. Note that if you do bonus #1, you'll have two words that start with "s." How do you resolve that?

Keep score of the player's and computer's wins. When either the player or computer reaches five wins, the match is over, and the winning player becomes the grand winner. Don't add your incrementing logic to display_results. Keep your methods simple; they should perform one logical task â€” no more, no less.
